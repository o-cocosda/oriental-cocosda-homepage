The technical interests of Cocosda are organised on both a country and a topical basis. Each country is represented on the central committee by country rapporteurs, and each agreed topic domain is represented by a topic domain rapporteur. Interaction between regional and topical rapporteurs provides that basis for the promotion and coordination activities of Cocosda to be informed by both the local and global expertise.
