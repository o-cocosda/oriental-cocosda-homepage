{{% blocks/cover title="About Oriental COCOSDA" image_anchor="bottom" height="full" %}}

Oriental COCOSDA (O-COCOSDA) originally is the Oriental branch of COCOSDA, which stands for the International Committee for the Coordination and Standardisation of Speech Databases and Assessment Techniques. Established in 1997, its primary goal is to foster idea exchange, share insights, and discuss regional matters related to the creation, use, and distribution of spoken language corpora for Oriental languages. Now O-COCOSDA is independent, with minimal ties to COCOSDA or other regional groups. Additionally, O-COCOSDA focuses on assessing speech recognition and synthesis systems while promoting speech research in Oriental languages.
